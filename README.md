## JavaScript Practice Problems

This folder contains a collection of small JavaScript coding exercises.

### Folder Structure

```bash
├── charFrequency/
├── countVowels/
├── firstNonRepeatingChar/
├── isAnagram/
├── isPalindrome/
├── largetNumber/
├── moveZerosToEnd/
├── sumArray/
├── removeElement/

└── README.md
```

### How to Run
All problems are written in plain JavaScript and can be run with Node.js.

1. **Open a terminal** in this folder:

```bash
cd /~path~/javascript-problems
```

2. **Run a specific problem** by changing into its folder and executing `index.js`:

```bash
node isAnagram/
```

Replace `isAnagram` with any other problem folder name (for example, `reverseString`, `sumArray`, etc.).

### Notes
- These files are intended for practice and experimentation; feel free to modify them, add new test cases, or create additional problem folders.
- If you use a different path on your machine, adjust the `cd` command accordingly.
